## **Introduction**

The <a href="https://devmountain-tracker.com/" target="_blank">DevMountain Student Tracker</a> is a web application with the purpose of detailing each students' progress throughout their time at DevMountain Phoenix. There is a student view along with a staff view. The staff view details other staff members, allows addition of competencies, and enables the ability to check off students' competencies and assessments. The student view allows students to see what assignments and projects are needed in order to badge. The end goal of this project is to be able to move every rubric for every project as well as adding things such as morning toy problems and a Phoenix resource page for newcomers to the city.
