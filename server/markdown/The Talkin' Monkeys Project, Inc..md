## **Introduction**

<a href="http://talkinmonkeysproject.org/" target="_blank">The Talkinâ€™ Monkeys Project, Inc.</a> is a sanctuary dedicated to providing a life-long home for animals that have been rescued from abusive private homes or released from research laboratories and breeding facilities.
I have volunteered there for a year while living in Florida and I wanted to attempt a redesign of the current website to try and attract more donations and volunteers from surrounding universities. Keep in mind the color scheme and content are filler for now. These are used to facilitate exploration of the layout of the site.

## **Technologies Used**

- React + Redux
- Node.js + Express
- Postgresql
- Cloudinary image uploader
- React-Facebook
- Nodemailer
- Stripe

## **The Challenge**

- Increase donations and volunteers
- Create a CMS for easy updating

## **The Journey**

Coming Soon...
